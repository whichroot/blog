I often ponder what makes us unique as Americans. 

Throughout our history, there has been acts of horror commited by our people. Americans have slaughtered Native Americans to colonize the region. Southern ex-confederates established the KKK to scare/harm/murder African-Americans away from their communities. If you want to take this into present time, the dismantling of DEI for workplace discrimination and the funding of ICE for the federal government's paramilitary. We are far from a perfect society. 

But we're a new dynasty; founded by the people that settled on this land and have remained triumphant so far in our ongoing quest for sovereignty. The acceleration of technology established our status as the tech capital of the world. Our warfighting capabilities allow us to remain in check with other nations with complex warfighting capabilities such as Russia or China or North Korea. Our medical and law programs are considered one of the best in the world. We produce some of the best frontier intellects in all walks of engineering and society. Not only that, but our ethics and social responsibility has also evolved in that timespan. We've championed for workers rights through the *Fair Labor Standards Act*, for civil rights through the *Civil Rights Act of 1964* and the *Voting Rights Act of 1965*, for child care for gay couples through the *Pavan v. Smith* ruling. As a society, we have previously set the gold standard of how to act, how to get rich, and how we should view our future. 

Humans are complex. We're tribal by nature, and depend on hierachy to establish structure. It just so happened that the humans in America believe in freedom.

Not all of us on this country share the same views of freedom as others. And honestly, nor should they. That would be paradoxial to the idea that freedom is limitless and would actually hinder progress on both sides. However, we must be in agreement that freedom enables all Americans the equal opportunity to grow and prosper. 

I believe that freedom is found in the art of expression. To have all the unique advantages of being in one of the most advanced nations in the world, but also the freedom to carve your own path. Be an influencer for positivity, a jeweler creating works of art, a musician conducting a symphony of sounds, a fashion designing bringing thier brand and vision to life, or even a coder creating the next generation of agentic AI. Whatever you believe in, that entrepreneurial spirit should be what drives this country forward, both technologically and progressivly.



However, there seems to be a certain group of very powerful individuals that do not honor that equal opportunity. The tech oligarchy believe that humans are born to be deviants, and to erase deviancy and to uplift poverty, we have to give up our autonomy to do so. They believe the only path out of poverty is to build software using their tools, on the hardware that they built, with the guidelines they set, and the marketplace they own. They refuse to acknowledge art as a symbol of progress, but rather believe it as the source of deviancy. 

Curtis Yarvin, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, J.D. Vance, Sam Altman, and Alex Karp are all intertwined. Curtis Yarvin is the godfather of the ideology of a philosophical state where the top engineers make the decisions of the masses through surveillance and control. Peter Thiel is the big funder, the man of endless pockets and connections. Elon Musk controls the flow of information, feeding information to social circles to disrupt critical thinking while also promoting the "America" party, designed to split votes from independents. J.D. Vance is the puppet, funded by Peter Thiel to roll out policy and orders to fulfill Curtis' ideology. Sam Altman is the creator of commercial and private AI, the engine used to process the mass amounts of data being ingested. Alex Karp is the CEO of Palantir, the software used to analyze the mass amounts of data to detect deviants. 

These people are not your friend. 

They want to take their bottom line and exploit them (the users) for every penny they have, and to establish control through fear by establishing America as a technocratic surveillance state. Their idea of America is a optimistic one, but one that comes with digital slavery and an erosion of all the progress that America has made socially while infringing on your digital privacy and rights. 

They believe that those with money should make decisions, and those who dont should not. They want to devalue the USD to establish decentralized influence over the economy. They want to exert their influence and power through the technology we use every day. They don't believe in uplifting Americans out of poverty, but only those who "deserve it" by their standards. It's the antithesis of freedom.


That being said, you are not powerless. **You should exercise your right to vote**. Their system only works if you're complicit, or do not care, or do not participate. Your vote represents freedom. Freedom that they cannot take away from you yet if you disallow it to happen. 

Art lessons are not important because everyone's going to end up becoming a painter, a sculpter, a poet, a musician, or whatever. They're important because it's a reminder of how social progress and technological advancements go hand in hand. If it were not for the federal government, we would not have the booming semiconductor industry. Had it not been for Martin Luther King Jr., we would still be white/colored segregated and miss out on the gems of what we call the melting pot of society. We're not perfect, but we have the potential to bring the best out of each other no matter what profession/path/phase we are in. And that's what freedom should stand for.
