title: "your opsec sucks"

Recently I stumbled on the website charliesmurderers[.]com created by the X user [@]forcharliekirk1.

I thought I was terminally online until I saw this. A blatant attempt to recreate doxbin for a political agenda. For those unaware, an anonymous user name KT created a clearnet site called doxbin. I'm not giving links to doxbin, you can find it on your own. You can kinda derive what purposes the site serves from the name alone. 

charliesmurderers[.]com is cut from the same cloth. "A little PHP code can't hurt anyone" - KT. 
In this case, the website was made with JS. This website represents a political agenda to depose educated individuals for exercising their first amendment right to free speech. Trust me, your information is already leaked in some russian database somewhere. It's not that serious.

But legality grey area and "for educational purposes" aside, it raises a bigger issue.

Your opsec sucks. But truth be told, everyone's opsec sucks. 
Thanks Mrs. R*** from school making everyone sign up for a g00gle account. You singlehandedly doomed our generation and potentially future generations from big tech data collection and oppression. Noah Michael Urban/kingbob/elijah, a previous Scattered Spider operative originating from HCF, was doxxed and his MC dox surfaced after his arrest. But I digress, that's a story on it's own and for another day.

Opsec is critical to operating in modern society. It's the core of your social identity. And yet, it's not taught in schools, or at least it wasn't taught to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Millenials/Gen X/Boomers are lucky, they were taught to not put information that can publicly identify you on the internet. And yet, even some of that crowd has taken to give Facebook their address and phone number, for some reason (idk, maybe they like being sent pizzas at 3am).

So you might be asking yourself - how do I make my opsec better? What even is opsec?

Well, opsec is short for operational security. It's how red teamers describe total anonymity. Basically, don't post identifing shit on social media or any public forum. 
Opsec IS personal identifying information. A name, a picture of you, an address, an email, a phone number. Anything that can identify you or where you live. Even so much as posting a picture of you in your neighborhood or backyard is damning. It's not difficult to extract metadata from a picture to find long/lat coordinates, or using overpass-turbo.eu to triangulate your location.

As for making yourself better at opsec, you can probably start with these changes:
- Start investing in a VPN. VPN your connection to your phone, your laptop, really anything with a wireless connection. I reccomend mullvad.net since you can send a cash check to them with no return address or pay with crypto, bypassing the need to record having a EMV transaction to purchase a VPN in the first place.
- Stop posting political shit on a public/main account. If you choose to do so, curate and audit your audience for loonies. Even better, make another (anonymous) account to do so. The bad guys use anonymitiy, the good guys use anonymity. It's time for you to do the same. Also, start privating your shit. Make a public social media page to interact with others, and a private one to illustrate your thoughts and beliefs.
- De-google your life. I reccomend starting with your email. Proton supports PGP by default, and if you want to be extra l33t you can host your own email web-server (don't do this unless you know what in the world you are doing). If you find it too difficult to break away from g00gle, at least turn off all personal identifiers and tracking information in g00gle. Opt out of every feature available in settings. Trust me, you don't need any of that available.
- Start making complex passwords, or better yet use a password manager like bitwarden.com or 1password.com to manage your logins. I can't stress how easy it is to spin up a residential proxy and hydra and go to town brute forcing someone's account with wildcards because I happen to find out from a leaked database they like to make passwords curating certain habits when doing so.
- Use encrypted communication channels to talk about sensitive or highly critical information. I reccomend signal.org, but even telegram etc. work in this scenario.
- KNOW YOUR RIGHTS. Certain states within the US and even outside the US certain countries have data privacy laws. If possible, send a GDPR/CCPA/VDCPA/etc. request to a website to remove your personal information. That can go a long way.

Don't let the radicalized script kiddies win. Take control of your identity. You only get one at the end of the day, no redo's allowed (unless you order a new dust filter for your Hoover MaxExtract Pressure Pro Model 60). Cheers.
